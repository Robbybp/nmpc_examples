Want to make an NMPC script for Kuan-Han's CSTR example that doesn't use
Caprese. Need to make sure I pass the same tests he has written.
What is Kuan-Han testing in the simulation and NMPC scripts?

NMPC tests:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tests controller setup.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item  Tests initial conditions of plant
      \item  and all values in controller model
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{test\_solve\_first\_control\_NLP}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Tests values at time 2.0 in controller model
      \item Tests value of \texttt{Tjinb} at position two in the controller
        dataframe.
      \item Tests values of plant at time 2.0
      \item Tests values in plant dataframe at position two
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{test\_run\_iterations}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Same tests as above, but runs ten NMPC steps instead of one
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
These tests seem very reasonable. But they do involve some Caprese-specific data
structures, like \texttt{plant\_df} and \texttt{nmpc.controller.mod}.
I should copy the functionality of the tests while scrapping the Caprese
objects, i.e. copy KH's model and re-implement his NMPC problem from scratch
with my own data structures.
Hopefully thsi is not too difficult\ldots
